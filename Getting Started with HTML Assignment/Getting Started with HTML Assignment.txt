Answer 2. Comments inside HTML are sections which tells the browser that it contains comments or any content that must
be ignored by the browser. The comments are enclosed within the <! -- --> tags which indicates that it should be rendered on the browser.

Example to show how comments are used inside html page:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <! -- This is a simple html page -->
    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a standard markup language used to create web pages.
       HTML defines the structure of web pages and how they look.</p>
    <br />
    <hr>
</body>
</html>

Answer 4. Tags are integral part of an html element. Tags begins with < symbols and ends with > symbol. Most tags require
closing tags. Some of the examples of tags are:
<p></p>
<h1></h1>

Elements form the entire web page. Elements comprise of tags, any tag attributes, content between the tags and the closing tag.
For example:
 <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
 <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.</p>
Here, the entire <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1> is one single element enclosed within the starting tag <h1> and ending tag </h1>.
Hence a web page can be said to be comprised of several such elements. The <html> element is the root element under which
all elements are placed.

Answer 5. The DOCTYPE declaration in html indicated by <!DOCTYPE html> at the start of the html pages
          informs the web browsers in what version of html the document is written. When <!DOCTYPE html> is mentioned 
          at start it simply informs the browser that this document type is a html 5 document and browser
          will display the web page in a way it is expected to be displayed.
